But for many other model architectures you'll want to rescale your data (e.g. get its values between 0 & 1). This could be incorporated inside your \"`preprocess_img()`\" function (like the one below) or within your model as a [`tf.keras.layers.Rescaling`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Rescaling) layer."

        "\n",
        "Before we can model our data, we have to turn it into batches.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why?\n",
        "\n",
        "Because computing on batches is memory efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "We turn our data from 101,000 image tensors and labels (train and test combined) into batches of 32 image and label pairs, thus enabling it to fit into the memory of our GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this in effective way, we're going to be leveraging a number of methods from the [`tf.data` API](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data).\n",
        "\n",
        "> 📖 **Resource:** For loading data in the most performant way possible, see the TensorFlow docuemntation on [Better performance with the tf.data API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance).\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, we're going to be using:\n",
        "\n",
        "* [`map()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#map) - maps a predefined function to a target dataset (e.g. `preprocess_img()` to our image tensors)\n",
        "* [`shuffle()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#shuffle) - randomly shuffles the elements of a target dataset up `buffer_size` (ideally, the `buffer_size` is equal to the size of the dataset, however, this may have implications on memory)\n",
        "* [`batch()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#batch) - turns elements of a target dataset into batches (size defined by parameter `batch_size`)\n",
        "* [`prefetch()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#prefetch) - prepares subsequent batches of data whilst other batches of data are being computed on (improves data loading speed but costs memory)\n",
        "* Extra: [`cache()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#cache) - caches (saves them for later) elements in a target dataset, saving loading time (will only work if your dataset is small enough to fit in memory, standard Colab instances only have 12GB of memory) \n",
        "\n",
        "Things to note:\n",
        "- Can't batch tensors of different shapes (e.g. different image sizes, need to reshape images first, hence our `preprocess_img()` function)\n",
        "- `shuffle()` keeps a buffer of the number you pass it images shuffled, ideally this number would be all of the samples in your training set, however, if your training set is large, this buffer might not fit in memory (a fairly large number like 1000 or 10000 is usually suffice for shuffling)\n",
        "- For methods with the `num_parallel_calls` parameter available (such as `map()`), setting it to`num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE` will parallelize preprocessing and significantly improve speed\n",
        "- Can't use `cache()` unless your dataset can fit in memory\n",
        "\n",
        "Woah, the above is alot. But once we've coded below, it'll start to make sense.\n",
        "\n",
        "We're going to through things in the following order:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Original dataset (e.g. train_data) -> map() -> shuffle() -> batch() -> prefetch() -> PrefetchDataset\n",
        "```\n",

Use the same evaluation techniques on the large-scale Food Vision model as you did in the previous notebook ([Transfer Learning Part 3: Scaling up](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/06_transfer_learning_in_tensorflow_part_3_scaling_up.ipynb)). More specifically, it would be good to see:\n",

Retrain the model (feature extraction and fine-tuning) we trained in this notebook, except this time use [`EfficientNetB4`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/EfficientNetB4) as the base model instead of `EfficientNetB0`. Do you notice an improvement in performance? Does it take longer to train? Are there any tradeoffs to consider?\n",
